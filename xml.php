Washington State is recognized globally as a premier tree fruit production region, with more than 230,000 acres of tree fruits statewide providing an annual economic impact of more than $6 billion. Over a third of the state’s fruit production is exported to markets worldwide. The Irrigated Agriculture Research and Extension Center (IAREC) is situated in one of the most agriculturally diverse regions in the U.S., where long, warm summer days, cool nights, low precipitation, and fertile soils make ideal conditions for irrigated fruit production, as well as other high-value horticultural crops. 

The Endowed Chair in Tree Fruit Soil and Rhizosphere Ecology is directly responsible to the Chair of the Department of Crop and Soil Sciences and the IAREC Director.
